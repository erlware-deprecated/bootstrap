This is only for creating an arch neutral bootstrapper for use with system that already have Erlang itself installed.

*Note* This bootstrapper does not create a full target system like the non-generic version.

To create a new generic boostrapper fetch a full faxien release. 
Alter each erts vsn string in the bin dir an the .rel file with !ERTS_VSN! 
then make sure the make_script.erl object code is in the release directory.
